# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A brand-new user arrives at the application by navigating to its URL in a modern mobile or desktop browser. They are presented with a clean sign-in screen that requests only their email address. Upon entering their email and tapping the send button, the app displays a confirmation message explaining that a magic link has been sent to their inbox and that it will remain valid for a short time. When the user clicks the magic link from their email on the same or a trusted device, they are automatically authenticated and taken back into the PWA without ever entering a password. The session persists for up to twenty-four hours or until the user closes their browser, ensuring that field teams can move between tasks without repeated logins.

Once authenticated, the user sees a full-screen liability disclaimer modal. The modal explains that all outputs are AI-generated and must be verified. The only actionable button reads “I agree this is AI and I will verify outputs.” Until the user taps that button, no other app features are accessible. After agreeing, the modal disappears and the user lands on the main dashboard.

At any point the user may open the header menu and tap “Sign Out,” which clears the session and returns them to the email input screen. If the magic link expires or is lost, the user can reenter their email on the sign-in page to request a new link. No password recovery flow is needed because the app uses passwordless authentication.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After accepting the liability disclaimer, the user arrives on the dashboard, which features five large cards arranged in a responsive layout. On mobile devices, cards stack vertically, each spanning the full width of the screen. On tablet and desktop, cards form a two-column grid. Each card displays an icon, the agent’s name, and a concise one-line description of its value. Above the cards, a global toggle lets the user switch between Field Mode and Office Mode. Field Mode applies a dark theme, enlarges touch targets, and emphasizes voice-first controls. Office Mode switches to a light theme, presents more condensed input fields and table previews, and prioritizes keyboard input.

The header remains visible across all dashboard screens. It contains the app logo (which can be replaced via configuration), the mode toggle, and a profile icon that opens account settings or sign-out. From this dashboard, the user may tap any agent card to begin its workflow. On tap, the corresponding module’s code and UI components are lazy-loaded, and a skeleton loader holds the screen until the workspace is ready.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When an agent workspace finishes loading, the user sees a consistent header bar that includes a back arrow to return to the dashboard, a confidence badge that updates with each AI response, and a “How to Use” button. Tapping “How to Use” opens a modal overlay containing an embedded tutorial video or fallback quick-start text if no video URL is configured.

In Site Scribe, the user chooses voice or text input. In Field Mode, a large microphone button invokes the Web Speech API for real-time transcription, and a tone toggle labeled Neutral, Firm, or CYA lets the user adjust style. After tapping “Generate,” the AI’s draft email streams into view line by line, with the confidence badge reflecting the model’s certainty. Once complete, the user taps an export button to copy to clipboard or open a mailto link in their default email client. The workspace remains until the user taps the back arrow.

In Lookahead Builder, the user may upload a photo or paste text. The photo upload accepts images up to ten megabytes in standard formats. If the user uploads a file that exceeds the size limit, an inline error message appears explaining the ten-megabyte constraint. Beneath the upload area, an optional text field lets the user describe tasks. After submission, the AI returns a streaming two-week schedule table. The partial table appears dynamically, showing date, task, crew size, and materials columns. Users can export the table to the clipboard or download an Excel file. They then tap the back arrow to return to the dashboard.

Code & Spec Commander prompts the user to upload a single PDF file no larger than twenty-five megabytes and no longer than one hundred pages. Client-side validation checks both limits and displays clear error messages if exceeded. After selecting a PDF, the user enters a technical question. The AI response streams in with mandatory citations formatted as page and section references. If the document does not contain the answer, the AI responds with “Not found in document.” The user copies the answer to their clipboard and returns to the dashboard via the back arrow.

Contract Hawk displays a dual-PDF uploader. The user provides their contract document, with the same twenty-five-megabyte and one-hundred-page limits enforced. Upon submission, the AI produces a risk table that assigns each clause a severity rating from one to five and a plain-English translation of any dangerous liability language. The table appears progressively as it streams. Export options for the risk table include clipboard, Excel download, or PDF export. The user finishes by navigating back to the dashboard.

Submittal Scrubber requires two PDF uploads: a specification file and a product data file, each subject to the twenty-five-megabyte and one-hundred-page constraints. After both files validate, the user taps “Compare,” and the AI generates a compliance table showing requirement, spec text, product text, and pass/warning/fail indicators. A streaming table preview appears, and the user can export the full table to Excel. Then they return to the dashboard.

Throughout all workspaces, if the user’s network connection drops, an overlay indicates loss of connectivity and provides a retry button. The AI streaming area pauses and automatically resumes once the connection is restored.

## Settings and Account Management
The profile icon in the header opens a simple account settings page. On this page, the user may view their email address, see their account creation date, and optionally add or update a company name. A sign-out button at the bottom ends the session and returns the user to the sign-in screen. Because the app does not store detailed preferences or notification settings, no further configuration options appear. After making any changes or signing out, the user either returns to the dashboard or to the sign-in page.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters an invalid email on the sign-in screen, the app displays an inline validation message prompting a properly formatted address. When requesting a magic link for an unregistered email, the app still shows a success confirmation for security but logs the address for administrative review. In the liability modal, no other actions are possible until acknowledgment.

File uploads across all agents check size and page limits before contacting the server. Files that exceed limits trigger immediate, clear error messages above the upload area. If the AI backend returns an error or the streaming API fails, the workspace displays an error banner with a retry action. Network interruptions prompt a connectivity banner overlay. If the user attempts to navigate back while an AI response is still streaming, the app shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental loss of in-progress output.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A typical user journey begins with emailing themselves a magic link, authenticating, and agreeing to the liability disclaimer. From the dashboard, they select an agent according to their task, whether drafting professional messages, generating schedules, searching documents, analyzing contracts, or verifying compliance. Each agent workspace guides the user through uploading or entering data, viewing streamed AI results with confidence indicators, and exporting outcomes directly in the browser. The global mode toggle adapts the UI for field or office environments. Users can manage their minimal profile details or sign out at any time. Throughout the session, client-side validations, clear error messages, and connectivity alerts ensure smooth operation. The entire flow is self-contained in the browser, leaving no persistent data behind once the user ends their session and closes the app.
